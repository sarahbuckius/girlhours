<h1>Girl Hours p5.js Code Generated by ChatGPT</h1>

<p> Generally, I am interested in how AI (suggest  changing this word to “automation”) represents and misrepresents issues related to DEI in technology. 
</br>
</br>
For this series of images, I am interested in how ChatGPT represents the concept of girl hours. For context, according to Wikipedia, girl-hour is "(historical, obsolete) A unit of computing power in the context of 1940s–1970s technology equal to one female worker working for one hour, for example, writing code or entering data to punch cards."

</br>
For more context, I found a recording that has since been removed from the internet!!! Luckily, I have it included in this folder for reference. <a href="4888-1-15203.mp3">Transcript</a> It used to be found at this link: 
</br><a href="https://www.aip.org/history-programs/niels-bohr-library/oral-histories/audio/4888-1">https://www.aip.org/history-programs/niels-bohr-library/oral-histories/audio/4888-1</a>
</br>
But, that page has disappeared, appropriately pointing to how it is impossible to write a history of the internet. How many revealing items have been removed so far? Here is a saved image to prove that it did once exist. <a href="screen-shot-2022-10-03-at-7.16.52-pm.png">Screenshot</a>

Under each image, you will find the prompt text used and some parts of the other verbiage in the output. </p>

Here is the interview transcript. 
</br>
“Weiner:</br>
You talk of the work on globular clusters and the revolutionary implications of it which you pursued and published. And you talked of “we.” Now, was this a solo effort or were there others involved with you in a discussion of this? You indicated that there wasn’t too much discussion, but this was a big thing.
</br>
Shapley:</br>
The discussion mostly was with Gretchen and maybe one or two assistants. You see, it took a tremendous lot of measures. I introduced the term “girl hours,” and it would take a lot of girl hours to solve some of the problems. In fact, one job took several kilo-girl hours to get it through. So I should say that I had help on a lot of the details. But I don’t think I had much help in the hunching.
</br>
Weiner:</br>
This was at Mount Wilson?
</br>
Shapley:</br>
Both places. But not many girl hours at Mount Wilson. Very few. I had one full time girl assistant as I got along, but there were very few at Mount Wilson whereas Harvard was just swarming with these assistants. That’s why we got somewhere, got it done. And elsewhere people had assistants. But I was at the observatory at Mount Wilson for many years when nobody was expected to have assistants.”</p>
